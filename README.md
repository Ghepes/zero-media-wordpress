### Frequently Asked Questions

What is Zero Media WordPress? Zero Media WordPress is a new plugin for the WordPress platform that replaces local media with external links.

Can the Zero Media WordPress plugin be used with WordPress Multisite?

Yes!


### **Manual External URL vs. Automatic Plugins: Why Manual is More Efficient**  

Yes, adding external URL links **manually** is far more efficient than relying on automatic plugins. Here’s why:  

1. **Cost-Effective & Scalable**  
   - Automatic plugins often impose **storage limits**, forcing users to switch to expensive **CDN mode**—which becomes prohibitively costly with high traffic (e.g., millions of image clicks).  
   - With **Zero Media WordPress (Manual Mode)**, you directly embed image/video links **without storage limits** and can leverage **free or low-cost global CDNs**, reducing long-term costs to **near zero**.  

2. **No Unnecessary Server Requests**  
   - Automatic plugins **ping the image server every 30 seconds**, creating unnecessary load.  
   - Manual embedding (e.g., `<img src="https://your-cdn.com/image.jpg">`) **eliminates extra requests**—your WordPress server isn’t burdened with fetching remote images.  

3. **Full Control & Flexibility**  
   - Host images **anywhere** (e.g., Cloudflare R2, BunnyCDN, Backblaze) without being locked into a plugin’s limited supported services.  
   - Avoid restrictions like **API quotas** or forced migrations when hitting plugin limits.  

4. **Performance & Security**  
   - Embedded links load **directly from the CDN**, reducing latency.  
   - No dependency on third-party plugin servers, minimizing **downtime risks**.  

### **The Professional Choice for Long-Term Efficiency**  
- **Zero extra costs** for image hosting.  
- **Zero unnecessary server requests**.  
- **Zero limits** from plugin providers.  

By adopting **manual external URL embedding**, you gain **full control, scalability, and cost efficiency**—critical for high-traffic sites.
